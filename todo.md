SOME - MINOR SUGGESTIONS :

1. Show Calculated Target Price
When user enters %, show what the actual price will be:
jsx
// Inside TP section
{tpPercent > 0 && (
  <div className="calculated-price">
    Target Price: <strong>${calculatedTPPrice.toLocaleString()}</strong>
  </div>
)}

2. Show Risk/Reward Ratio
When both TP and SL are set:
jsx
// At bottom of modal, before Confirm button
{tpPercent > 0 && slPercent > 0 && (
  <div className="risk-reward-display">
    <span className="label">Risk/Reward Ratio:</span>
    <span className={`ratio ${rrRatio >= 1 ? 'good' : 'bad'}`}>
      1:{rrRatio.toFixed(2)}
    </span>
  </div>
)}

3. Slider Color Coding
   css
   /_ Take Profit slider - green gradient _/
   .tp-slider::-webkit-slider-track {
   background: linear-gradient(to right,
   rgba(0,255,0,0.1) 0%,
   rgba(0,255,0,0.3) 100%
   );
   }

/_ Stop Loss slider - red gradient _/
.sl-slider::-webkit-slider-track {
background: linear-gradient(to right,
rgba(255,0,0,0.1) 0%,
rgba(255,0,0,0.3) 75%
);
}

4. Validation Messages
   jsx
   // If TP is below entry (for Long)
   {side === 'Long' && tpPrice < entryPrice && (
   <span className="error">‚ö†Ô∏è TP must be above entry price</span>
   )}

// If SL is above entry (for Long)
{side === 'Long' && slPrice > entryPrice && (
<span className="error">‚ö†Ô∏è SL must be below entry price</span>
)}

MY PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATION FOR TRADING:
We will GO WITH YELLOW/GOLD üü°

üèÜ WHY YELLOW IS BETTER FOR OUR PLATFORM

1. Trading Platform Psychology
   text
   Yellow/Gold = Money, Profit, Success ‚úì
   Orange = Energy, Action (more suitable for fitness/food apps)

2. Color Harmony
   text
   Yellow + Green (profit) = ‚úì Works well
   Yellow + Red (loss) = ‚úì Distinct enough

Orange + Green (profit) = ‚ö†Ô∏è Too similar (both warm)
Orange + Red (loss) = ‚ùå Clash (both aggressive)

3. Industry Standard
   text
   Bybit, Binance, Huobi = Yellow ‚Üí Proven to work
   Users expect it in trading platforms
   Feels "at home" for traders

4. Visibility
   text
   Yellow on dark = ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent contrast
   Orange on dark = ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Good, but less striking

5. Brand Positioning
   text
   Yellow = "Professional trading platform" (like the big guys)
   Orange = "Innovative startup" (less established feeling)

[v] Quickly closing issue - if I hit close it should remove quickly but there is delay
[v] Time zone
[v] Redirect issue
[v] Limit market issue
[v] Chart price are not moving in sync with order book
[v] Virtual balance negative issue.
[v] Lag in the position tab.
[v] In the tp/sl number issue.
