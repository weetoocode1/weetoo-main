# 🧠 Leverage Fundamentals (Simple Explanation)

## 💡 What Leverage Means

Leverage means **you borrow money to make a bigger trade**.

- **Without leverage (1x):**  
  You trade only with your own money.  
  Example: You have $1,000 → You can buy $1,000 worth of Bitcoin.  
  If Bitcoin goes up by 1%, you make **$10**.  

- **With 10x leverage:**  
  You borrow 9 times your money.  
  So $1,000 lets you trade $10,000 worth of Bitcoin.  
  If Bitcoin goes up 1%, you make **$100** (10 times more).  
  But if Bitcoin goes down 1%, you **lose $100** (10 times faster too).  

👉 **Leverage multiplies both your profits and your losses.**

## 🧮 Key Concepts (Explained Simply)

### 1. Position Size
How big your trade is.  
More leverage = bigger position.

**Example:**  
$1,000 with 10x leverage → You control $10,000 worth of BTC.

---

### 2. Margin
The money you must **keep locked** to hold your trade — like a **security deposit**.

- **Initial margin:** Needed to open the trade.  
- **Maintenance margin:** Minimum you must keep to avoid liquidation.

---

### 3. Liquidation Price
The price where your trade is **automatically closed** because you ran out of margin.

Higher leverage = liquidation price closer to your entry.

**Example:**  
You long BTC at $50,000 with 10x leverage → if BTC falls to around **$45,200**, you’re liquidated.

---

### 4. Unrealized PnL (Profit or Loss)
How much you’re **currently up or down** based on market price.  
It changes every second.

**Example:**  
You bought 0.2 BTC at $50,000 → Now BTC is $51,000 → You’re up **$200** (but haven’t closed yet).

---

### 5. ROE (Return on Equity)
How much profit or loss you made **compared to your margin**.

**Example:**  
Profit: $200 on $1,000 margin → ROE = **20%**.

---

### 6. Margin Ratio
Shows how close you are to liquidation.

- **100% = Liquidated**
- **80%+ = High risk zone**

---

## ⚠️ Key Warnings

- Higher leverage = **higher risk** — small price moves can wipe you out.  
- Always check if you have enough balance (margin).  
- Different coins have different max leverages (BTC 125x, SOL 50x).  
- Exchanges like Binance/Bybit use similar systems.
